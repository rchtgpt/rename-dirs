## Rename Dirs

A python script to rename multiple directories to lowercase words with underscore separators.

## Why?

I like to keep my PC's folder structure neat and uniform but, during intense hackathons, i mess up my project's folder name format. Thought automating the renaming process would make my life easier.

## Format

`Example File.txt` -> `example_file.txt`

## Installation

```bash
pip install rename-dirs
```
